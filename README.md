Hardware:
Lenovo Thinkstation P310
16 GB DDR4 2133mhz RAM
AMD Firepro W7000 GPU
Intel Xeon 4 Core 8 Thred (Skylake)

I'm attempting to boot macOS Catalina on this machine but it hangs up on calling mpo_policy_init for ASP.
I stripped away the network driver and the AppleALC.kext file to deal with that post install. I'm having trouble booting this machine with opencore.
